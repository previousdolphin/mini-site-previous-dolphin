# 🐬 mini-site-previous-dolphin  

A **website in 10 minified lines of HTML**.  
Built as a proof-of-concept: clean, responsive, and extendable into bigger projects.  

🌐 **Live Demo:** [previousdolphin.github.io/mini-site-previous-dolphin](https://previousdolphin.github.io/mini-site-previous-dolphin/)  

---

## ✨ Features
- Fully functional single-page app in **~10 lines**
- Responsive layout with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Animated background using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- Countdown timer hidden until the “mystery” section
- Minimal but expandable foundation for your own mini-sites

## 📦 Use It As a Template
This repo is designed as a **starting point**.  
Fork it, tweak it, and quickly spin up:
- Landing pages  
- Personal splash sites  
- Lightweight prototypes  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
All logic, styles, and markup are **inline**.  
The entire site can be compressed into a single file under 10 lines, yet still provide:
- Navigation  
- Sections  
- Animations  
- Styling

## 🔎 How to “Un-minify”
Want to work with readable code instead of compressed one-liners?  
You can **un-minify** the HTML in a few ways:
1. Open the file in VS Code and use **Format Document** (`Shift+Alt+F` / `Shift+Option+F`).  
2. Paste the code into an online tool like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/playground/) or [Beautifier.io](https://beautifier.io/).  
3. Use CLI tools such as:  
   bash
   npx prettier index.html --write
    

This will expand the site back into a full, indented, human-readable source you can extend.
